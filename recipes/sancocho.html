        <p> Sancocho is a Latin chicken soup with cilantro and yuca (or cassava). Keep in mind, there are a variety of recipes out there this is just the one my nanny used to make us.</p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>9 cups water</li>
            <li>1 whole chicken</li>
            <li>2 plantains, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>3 pounds yuca (cassava) roots, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
            <li>6 small red potatoes, quatered</li>
            <li> (15.25 ounce) can corn, drained </li> 
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Pot Mix</h3>
                <p>Combine water, chicken, plantains, onion, cilantro, garlic, and salt in a large pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium; cook until chicken is longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Let the chicken cool, add potatoes instead!</h3>
                <p>Remove the chicken and let cool. Add yuca, potatoes, and corn to the soup; cook over medium heat until yuca and potatoes are softened, about 30 minutes. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Discard skin and bones</h3>
                <p>Discard chicken skin and bones. Place meat back into the soup; stir to combine. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
