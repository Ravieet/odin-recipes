    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Make the patties</h3>
                <p>Mix ground sirloin, panko bread crumbs, egg, milk, 1/2 packet onion soup mix, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper together in a large bowl; shape into 5 patties.  </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Heat on the patties</h3>
                <p>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in the hot skillet until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Make the gravy</h3>
                <p>Melt butter in a separate skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté mushrooms and onion in melted butter until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir flour and remaining 1/2 packet onion soup mix into mushroom mixture until combined. </p>
            <li>
                <h3>Until simmering</h3>
                <p>Gradually add beef stock and water, stirring continually, until simmering. Reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring frequently, until gravy has thickened, about 4 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. </p>
            <li>
                <h3>Into the gravy</h3>
                <p>Place browned patties into gravy; simmer until very tender, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). </p>
            
            </ol>
