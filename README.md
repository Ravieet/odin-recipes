I have learned plenty so far in my endevours. 
Albeit, not in a practical sense, most of my 
knowledge in this point in time is surrounding 
the background needed to understand what am I 
actually making such as understanding the web 
and browsers and such.

Here we see only a fraction of this being
applied, this is an html skeleton with images
and content in a proper format. Ain't the 
prettiest, but well, there is a reason that CSS
is usually referred to as "The Artist" hahah.

I can't wait to learn more and make websites now
with CSS!
